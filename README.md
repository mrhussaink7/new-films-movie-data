# Recommending Film Production Using Box-Office Data
This project explores various high-performing box office films to provide insights that can help movie studios decide what type of films to create. By analyzing trends and patterns in successful movies, we aim to offer data-driven recommendations for future film productions.

Datasets:
- bom.movie_gross.csv (movie revenue)
- im.db (SQL database with 8 tables of box-office data)
- rt.movie_info.tsv (movie numerical details)
- rt.reviews.tsv (movie reviews)
- tmdb.movies.csv (IMDB movie details and ratings)
- tn.movie_budgets.csv (movie budget data before production)

Goal:
We work in the data-science team of a film studio who creates various films. The data-science team is tasked with analyzing successful box-office films to create 3 recommended films for the film studio.
The film studio wants to ensure their new film reaches box-office success, and the data-science team can help by analyzing the patterns and trends that made past box-office films successful.

Questions:
- What type of genres are abundant in box-office films?
- What is the likelihood of the different films to produce succeeding into box-office success?
- What are the commonalities amongst box-office films?
- What keywords exist in box-office reviews to ensure our new films achieve the same reviews?
